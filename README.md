## [DNA methylation calling to infer genomic clock](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Bioinformatics-pipeline/tree/main/DNA%20methylation%20calling%20to%20infer%20genomic%20clock)
- Streamlined ribosomal DNA methylation (rDNAm) clock pipeline (Lemos and Wang, 2019) including 
  - data processing and quality control with reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data
  - applying Bismark to conduct methylation extraction to estimate rDNAm age
- Applied rDNAm pipeline to reprogramming stem cells at different time points and followed up with RNA-seq data to identify reprogramming markers that could cause less successful reprogramming states

## [Parallelized Computation for pairwise regression analysis](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Bioinformatics-pipeline/blob/main/multiple_linear_regression_parallel.R)
- Streamlined parallel computation script to incorporate pre-defined objective functions (regression for pairwise features of interest) 
 
## [Rapid inference for leading edge genes from gene set enrichment analysis](https://github.com/estelleyao0530/Bioinformatics-pipeline/blob/main/gsea_save.R)
- compiled list of genesets for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) and included all member genes in the genesets.
- Useful for enrichment analysis on the second-layer gene level enrichment
